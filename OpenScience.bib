	abstract = {Assessments of vegetation condition, cover, change, and processes are major ­components of global change research programs, and are topics of considerable societal relevance. Spectral vegetation indices are among the most widely used satellite data products, which provide key measurements for climate, hydrologic, and biogeochemical studies; phenology, land cover, and land cover change detection; natural resource management and sustainable development. Vegetation indices (VI) are robust and seamless data products computed similarly across all pixels in time and space, regardless of biome type, land cover condition, and soil type, and thus represent true surface measurements. The simplicity of VIs enables their amalgamation across ­sensor systems, which facilitates an ensured continuity of critical datasets for long-term land surface modeling and climate change studies. Currently, a more than two decades long NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)-derived consistent global normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) land record exists, which has contributed significantly to global biome, ecosystem, and agricultural studies.},

	abstract = {Groundwater is a vital water supply worldwide for people and nature. However, species and ecosystems that depend on groundwater for some or all of their water needs, known as groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs), are increasingly becoming threatened worldwide due to growing human water demands. Over the past two decades, the protection and management of GDEs have been incorporated into several water management policy initiatives worldwide including jurisdictions within Australia, the European Union, South Africa, and the United States. Among these, Australia has implemented the most comprehensive framework to manage and protect GDEs through its water policy initiatives. Using a science-based approach, Australia has made good progress at reducing uncertainty when selecting management thresholds for GDEs in their water management plans. This has been achieved by incorporating appropriate metrics for GDEs into water monitoring programs so that information gathered over time can inform management decisions. This adaptive management approach is also accompanied by the application of the “Precautionary Principle” in cases where insufficient information on GDEs exist. Additionally, the integration of risk assessment into Australia's approach has enabled water managers to prioritize the most valuable and vulnerable ecologic assets necessary to manage GDEs under Australia's national sustainable water management legislation. The purpose of this paper is to: (1) compare existing global policy initiatives for the protection and management of GDEs; (2) synthesize Australia's adaptive management approach of GDEs in their state water plans; and (3) highlight opportunities and challenges of applying Australia's approach for managing GDEs under other water management policies worldwide.},

	volume = {44},
	url = {https://doi.org/10.1071/SR05037},
	abstract = {Palaeochannels, or prior streams, are strings of sandier sediments that occur frequently in the irrigated alluvial plains of Northern New South Wales, Australia. These landscape features have been recognised as locations of substantial deep drainage losses, and are therefore target areas for water use efficiency. Electromagnetic induction (EM) measurements were used to identify the width and the depth of the palæochannel sediments in a 2-dimensional transect. Three different inversion techniques, Tikhonov regularisation, the McNeill layered earth model, and an optimal linear combination of EM measurements, were applied to a combination of EM-38 and EM-34 data. Using various kriging techniques, the resulting conductivity profiles were interpolated to soil property data and transformed to saturated hydraulic conductivities using pedotransfer functions. There were distinct differences in the resulting stratigraphies depending on the inversion and interpolation method employed. Trend kriging of the sampled soil property data using the Cook and Walker and Tikhonov inversion data as a trend surface gave the most consistent hydraulic conductivity values compared to the sampled soil property data. However, differences between inversion and interpolation methods were negated by uncertainties in the pedotransfer functions.},

	abstract = {Citizen science, the involvement of volunteers in research, has increased the scale of ecological field studies with continent-wide, centralized monitoring efforts and, more rarely, tapping of volunteers to conduct large, coordinated, field experiments. The unique benefit for the field of ecology lies in understanding processes occurring at broad geographic scales and on private lands, which are impossible to sample extensively with traditional field research models. Citizen science produces large, longitudinal data sets, whose potential for error and bias is poorly understood. Because it does not usually aim to uncover mechanisms underlying ecological patterns, citizen science is best viewed as complementary to more localized, hypothesis-driven research. In the process of addressing the impacts of current, global “experiments” altering habitat and climate, large-scale citizen science has led to new, quantitative approaches to emerging questions about the distribution and abundance of organisms across space and time.},

	abstract = {Scholarly works have been placed as the starting point for many academia (scientists, researchers, lecturers) and lecturers to establish their research focus and academic reputation, as well as academic career. However, scholarly documents have been developed in a conventional way, the same way in centuries, in form of research reports, peer-reviewed journal articles, conference abstracts and/or patents. This paper aims to open a new horizon in scholarly works in the mind of Indonesia academia, to a more open, accessible, and inclusive manner. By introducing the open science concept, we aim for more scientific impacts, as have been developed as a movement now in the world. This concept shifts how we see scholarly works from individually-owned, closed, and centralized documents into a community-owned, opened, and distributed ones. To get a better idea of open science and how it can fit in to Indonesia’s research workflow, we reviewed papers, conference abstracts, blogs, and institutional websites under key terms “open science” and “open access”. We used free access databases: Google Scholar, ScienceOpen, Pubmed Central (PMC) and also individual journal repositories: PLOS, e-life, and F1000Research.},
